For the Spotify\nscenario, choose \"{{JsonPayload}}\" as your search query.\n- Tap the \"Create Action\" button to save your action settings.\n- Once you have finished configuring your action, click the \"Finish\" button to\ncomplete the setup.\n- Congratulations! You have successfully connected the Webhook to the desired\nservice, and you're ready to start receiving data and triggering actions ðŸŽ‰\n\n# Finishing up\n- To get your webhook URL go to https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks/settings\n- Copy the IFTTT key value from there. The URL is of the form\nhttps://maker.ifttt.com/use/YOUR_IFTTT_KEY. Grab the YOUR_IFTTT_KEY value.\n */\nimport { Tool } from \"@langchain/core/tools\";\n\n/**\n * Represents a tool for creating and managing webhooks with the IFTTT (If\n * This Then That) service.
